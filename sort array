You are given an array consisting of 'N' positive integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 or 2. Your task is to sort the given array in non-decreasing order.

Note :
1. The array consists of only 3 distinct integers 0, 1, 2.
2. The array is non-empty.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^4
0 <= arr[i] <= 2

where arr[i] is the array element at index 'i'.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
2
5
2 0 1 0 2
2
0 1
Sample Output 1 :
0 0 1 2 2
0 1
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
Test Case 1: After sorting the array in ascending order, we will get 0 0 1 2 2

Test Case 2: The array is already in ascending order.
Sample Input 2 :
2
6
2 1 0 0 1 2
3
0 0 0
Sample Output 2 :
0 0 1 1 2 2
0 0 0
